# ellipseC
C++ code to detect precise ellipse center using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The code is a part of chromatic aberration correction software, as well as calibration matrix calculator.

The program takes an ellipse image as input and prints its precise parameters (center coordinates are among them) as output.
