# ellipseC
C++ code to detect precise ellipse center using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The code is a part of [chromatic aberration correction software](https://github.com/vicrucann/corrCA-prototype), as well as [calibration matrix calculator](https://github.com/vicrucann/Kmat-virtual).

The program takes an ellipse image as input and prints its precise parameters (center coordinates are among them) as output.
